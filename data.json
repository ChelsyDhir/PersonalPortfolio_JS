      "description": "STEP-UP is a loan management system that involves an automated processing of loans to SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)  and a userâ€™s portal that will enable them to post blogs, articles or reviews. Individuals or business owners are encouraged to enroll in a program that will assist them to  set-up or improve their products, services, and operations to elevate their productivity and competitiveness. The program includes seminars (like Food Processing, ICT/Electronics, Handicrafts) and a loan that they can borrow to kick-off or boost-up their business. The project focuses on the loan management (from application, approval, computation to payments) and the portal where borrowers can post their stories, like how they started or how their business is doing.
